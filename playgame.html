      <h3>Salisbury Cathedral</h3><br>
      <img src="images/salis.jpg"></a>
      <p>The United Kingdom’s Salisbury Cathedral, consecrated in 1258, is an Anglican cathedral built in the Early English Gothic style. The Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as it is also known, includes a heavily buttressed church spire – the tallest in the UK - that contains no bell. The cathedral is home to the oldest working clock in the world (built in 1386 or possibly earlier) and one of the original surviving copies of the Magna Carta.</p><br>
